# Grigora

Grigora  is a library containing optimised implementation of common preprocessing utilities from deep learning libraries such as Keras.

The goal of this project is to offer ~5-20x speedup over original implementations by porting the original implementations to Cython modules.

Grigora is compatible with Python 2.7-3.7.
